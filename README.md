# handsontable-6.2.2-docs
Documentation of the handsontable 6.2.2

# Description
This repo contains the documentacions of the last MIT released handsontable library 6.2.2, for some obscure reason the documentacion of the library disapear for this version and previous releases, searching by the net and reading all repos from the handsontable project, I found the follow repos and trees:

- https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/tree/6.2.2
- https://github.com/handsontable/docs-archive/tree/6.0.1

The first repo contains the handsontable code and the second repo contains the needed code to build the documentation, in a new releases, the documentation can be build using the tools of the same first repo, but for the old 6.2.2 release, is needed to play with the two repos to generate the documentation.
